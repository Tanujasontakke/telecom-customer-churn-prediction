# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction 📉

This project analyzes a real-world telecom dataset from Kaggle to predict customer churn using machine learning. It includes end-to-end data processing, visualization, model evaluation, and business insights.

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (CLV, risk score, charges ratio)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification using Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, AUC, and classification report
- Key churn factors and actionable retention strategies

## 🧠 Models

| Model              | Accuracy | AUC Score |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 80.4%    | 0.848     |
| Random Forest       | 79.1%    | 0.827     |

## 📌 Insights

- High churn among month-to-month customers
- Higher monthly charges linked to churn
- Lack of tech support/security services increases churn risk
- Auto-payment methods reduce churn
